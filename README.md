## Notes

I encountered a challenge while importing pictures into Android Studio. I tried multiple times in different ways with different paths, and finally used the most regular way to solve it. I also encountered an issue while submitting it through Git. It is about creating a repository within Android Studio and push the package into GitHub. Then I tried a different method, which is to create a repository on GitHub and then share the package to this repository, which should finally resolve this problem.
